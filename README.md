Challenges:
Making a grid of squares
- Had to review flexbox after 2 weeks
- First attempted to make a continuous line of squares and then have them wrap to new lines to form a proper grid using flex and properties such as height and width
- First attempt did not work so instead implemented for loops that made divs (rows and columns/squares)

Learned:
- Why script tag is put at end of HTML body (DOM loading)
- flex: 1's and aspect-ratio: 1/1's effect on width and height of children
